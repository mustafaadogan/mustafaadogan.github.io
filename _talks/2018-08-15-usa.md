During my undergraduate studies at Konya Food and Agriculture University (KFAU), I was fortunate to participate in an exceptional opportunity that took me across the globe to Michigan State University (MSU), USA. This visit was part of a collaborative agreement between my university and MSU, where I was selected to work in Sungeon Cho's Sensory Lab—a hub of innovative research that bridges multiple disciplines.

KFAU and MSU share a strong collaborative relationship, fostering academic exchange and research opportunities. Through this agreement, I was able to immerse myself in a unique multidisciplinary environment that allowed me to apply and expand my knowledge in new and exciting ways.

During my time at MSU, I contributed to the Sensory Lab by conducting an analysis that explored the intricate relationship between sleeping patterns and eating habits. Utilizing powerful Python libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn, I was able to visualize and analyze data, uncovering patterns that could have significant implications for understanding human behavior and health.

In addition to my work with Python, I applied Bayes Theorem to evaluate test results, providing a probabilistic framework for understanding the data. This, combined with my proficiency in MS Office, allowed me to offer valuable insights to the collaborating companies associated with the lab. These insights not only contributed to ongoing research but also had practical applications in the real world, making the experience both academically enriching and professionally rewarding.

Working in Sungeon Cho's Sensory Lab was a truly multidisciplinary experience, blending elements of data science, behavioral studies, and applied mathematics. The collaborative environment at MSU encouraged me to think critically and approach problems from multiple angles, a skill that is invaluable in today’s interconnected world. This experience broadened my understanding of how different fields can come together to address complex issues, and it reinforced the importance of collaboration in research. It also gave me the opportunity to engage with experts from diverse backgrounds, enhancing my ability to communicate and work effectively in a team.
