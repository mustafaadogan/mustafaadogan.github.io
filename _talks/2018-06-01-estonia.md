### Overview of the Project

Youth unemployment has been a persistent issue across Europe, with statistics from Eurostat indicating that the youth unemployment rate was 21.7% in July 2014, and while it decreased slightly to 18.6% by December 2016, the figures remain concerning. Countries like Greece, Spain, Italy, and Croatia recorded some of the highest rates, underscoring the urgent need for innovative solutions to address this challenge.

One of the most promising solutions to combat youth unemployment is entrepreneurship, particularly social entrepreneurship. Social entrepreneurship offers young people the opportunity to address social problems creatively, fostering the creation of alternative jobs and income streams. However, many young people lack the necessary skills and knowledge to successfully launch and sustain their own enterprises, which is where NGOs and similar organizations can play a crucial role.

The **“Sail With EntrepreneurShip” Youth Exchange** was designed to develop the social entrepreneurship skills of young people, providing them with the tools, knowledge, and experience needed to transform their ideas into viable social enterprises. This project aimed to equip youth leaders and volunteers, aged between 18-30, with the practical skills necessary to work with youth on social entrepreneurship and to help them run social enterprises within their organizations.

### Objectives of the Project

The project was built in line with the objectives of the Erasmus+ Programme, and its primary goals were:

1. **Develop Key Skills:** Enhance creative thinking, soft skills, financial management, strategic planning, and social entrepreneurship skills.
2. **Knowledge Transfer:** Share knowledge and experiences on motivating young people to pursue entrepreneurial paths.
3. **Project Development:** Offer a framework for developing, validating, and implementing social entrepreneurial projects.
4. **Support System:** Explore practical ways to support young people in setting up social enterprises, considering legal, financial, management, and social requirements.
5. **Equip Youth Leaders:** Provide youth leaders and volunteers with tools and methods designed to develop entrepreneurial skills.
6. **Innovation in Methods:** Develop new methods and tools for working on social entrepreneurship.
7. **Experience Exchange:** Facilitate the exchange of experience and expertise in social entrepreneurship among participants.
8. **Erasmus+ Opportunities:** Inform participants about opportunities to develop new projects under the Erasmus+ Programme.
