My responsibilities extend to the delicate task of managing communication between environment units, a task executed with precision using a spectrum of communication protocols such as UDP, TCP, RS422, Can Bus, and DDS. The orchestration of these protocols demands a mastery of programming languages, and I have adeptly navigated the intricacies of C++, IBM Rational Rhapsody, Visual Studio, and Eclipse for software development and rigorous testing.
