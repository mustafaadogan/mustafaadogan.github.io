 I was bestowed with the privilege of undertaking an internship within the realm of a sensory evaluation laboratory, a distinctive venture orchestrated through a specialized program interlinking Michigan State University and KGTU. Throughout this immersive experience, I underwent comprehensive training in the meticulous analysis and visualization of data, specifically aimed at unraveling the intricate dynamics of the correlation between sleeping patterns and dietary behaviors. This journey, extended beyond the confines of my customary sphere, not only broadened my horizons in project execution but also honed my prowess in navigating the intricacies of multidisciplinary domains.

Furthermore, I found myself amidst the orchestration of an international laboratory, an amalgamation of scientific minds hailing from diverse cultures. This served as an invaluable juncture, providing me with the profound opportunity to perceive a singular subject through a kaleidoscope of perspectives. In this milieu, I adeptly applied Bayes Theorem and Microsoft Excel Tools to scrutinize test results, subsequently imparting insightful inferences to collaborating companies. Delving into the nuanced interplay between sleep patterns and dietary choices, I employed the sophisticated tools of matplotlib and Seaborn libraries in Python 3 to craft visual narratives that unraveled the intricate tapestry of human habits.
