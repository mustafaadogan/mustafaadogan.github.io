During the summer, I actively contributed to a collaborative project focused on identifying stock exchange market speculators and influencers, employing advanced Machine Learning algorithms. As a cohesive team, we meticulously curated an extensive dataset comprising approximately 3.4 million tweets from over 50,000 users. This vast dataset was ingeniously organized and managed within an SQLite database.

Our project centered on employing sentiment analysis as a guiding principle. We delved into the creation of distinct machine learning models, each encapsulating unique facets of data analysis. Through meticulous comparison and evaluation of these models, we unveiled nuanced insights, illuminating the complex landscape of stock market influencers.

Our collaborative efforts culminated in a comprehensive research article, where I proudly assumed the role of the first author. This publication encapsulated compelling results and insightful findings derived from our research endeavors. Notably, our work was accepted by the esteemed 2020 IEEE International Conference on Big Data. The acceptance of our article by the conference committee serves as a testament to the caliber and significance of our research.

I am eagerly looking forward to presenting our research findings at the conference, scheduled to take place from the 10th to the 13th of December. It's an exciting opportunity to share our insights and contribute to the ongoing discourse in the field of Machine Learning applied to financial markets.
