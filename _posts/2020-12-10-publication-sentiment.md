This summer, I actively contributed to a collaborative project dedicated to identifying stock exchange market speculators and influencers through the discerning lens of Machine Learning algorithms. As a cohesive team effort, we meticulously curated an extensive dataset, housing nearly 3.4 million tweets sourced from over 50,000 users, ingeniously organized within an SQLite database.

Employing sentiment analysis as our guiding compass, we embarked on a journey of model creation, crafting distinct algorithms that encapsulated various facets of machine learning. Through meticulous comparison of these models, we unveiled nuanced results, each algorithm offering a unique perspective on the intricate landscape of stock market influencers.

The culmination of our efforts materialized in a comprehensive article, where I proudly assumed the role of the first author. Our research, encapsulating compelling results and insightful findings, found its home in the esteemed 2020 IEEE International Conference on Big Data. The acceptance of our article by the conference committee stands as a testament to the merit of our research, and I look forward to presenting our work from the 10th to the 13th of December.
