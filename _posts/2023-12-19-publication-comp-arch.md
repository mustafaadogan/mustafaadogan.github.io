I'm thrilled to announce some incredible news - our paper has been accepted for publication in <a href="https://peerj.com">PeerJ Computer Science Journal</a>! It's been an incredible journey co-authoring this with the esteemed Professors Kasım Öztoprak and Mehmet Reşit Tolun. This moment signifies an important milestone as it marks my very first journal publication. The article titled "Teaching Computer Architecture by Designing and Simulating Processors from Their Bits and Bytes" delves into innovative teaching methods for undergraduate Computer Architecture (Comp-Arch) courses. This journey has been immensely rewarding, and I'm excited to share our insights with the academic community.

The paper emphasizes the effectiveness of this hands-on approach by presenting collected student feedback. Results from a questionnaire, employing various Likert scale questions, demonstrate a clear enhancement in students' motivation and knowledge in the Comp-Arch course, which forms the cornerstone of computer system design principles.

Moreover, this approach holds promise for related courses like Microprocessor Design, shedding light on the complexities of creating and implementing microprocessors at the hardware level. Additionally, the study showcases the invaluable impact of student interactions, such as peer reviews and public presentations, in enriching their understanding and perspective on custom processor design.
