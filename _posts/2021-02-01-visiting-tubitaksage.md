During my tenure with TÜBİTAK SAGE as part of the STAR Intern Research Program until July's denouement, I found my professional home within the esteemed Software Architecture Design team. This avant-garde team spearheads the development of the intricate software architecture that serves as the digital pulse for missiles in action. Beyond this critical task, the team engages in the crafting of desktop applications, wielding the prowess of languages such as C, Python, and other requisite coding languages, orchestrating simulations and data collection in anticipation of firing tests.

In my capacity, I assumed the mantle of responsibility for crafting a desktop application designed to breathe life into the visualization of multiple dimensions of missile data. This bespoke application, a testament to cutting-edge technology, not only facilitated the concurrent visualization of diverse scenarios but also harnessed the power of multi-threading, elevating its efficiency and functionality to new heights.

Moreover, I lent my skills to the development of a C# multi-threading form application. This intricate piece of software artistry brought the intended missile data to life on a visual graph, seamlessly blending the intricacies of N-tier Architecture, Reflection, and PlotLab libraries provided by Microsoft and MitovLab.
