During my internship at HAVELSAN EHSIM, I delved into FPGA applications, particularly within the context of F-16 aircraft. One significant task involved crafting a memory map using bit-fields under the stringent MIL-STD-1553 communication protocol. This endeavor not only expanded my technical expertise but also deepened my understanding of the precision required in aviation systems.

As a sophomore, my journey extended to implementing a finite state machine, a digital-to-analog transformation executed on the MYD-C7Z015 Development Board, guided by the rigorous standards of LTC-2601. This experience at HAVELSAN EHSIM allowed me to navigate the complexities of electronic warfare suite controllers for F-16 aircraft, laying the groundwork for a nuanced understanding of these systems.
