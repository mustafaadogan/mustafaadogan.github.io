Since my early years, aviation and its intricacies have held a profound fascination for me. The allure lies in understanding the symbiotic interplay of subsystems within an aircraft—how navigation systems seamlessly dance with flight control mechanisms, and the delicate choreography of decision-making within computer systems. Driven by this enduring curiosity, I embarked on my initial foray into the aviation domain through an internship at HAVELSAN EHSIM, delving into the intricate world of FPGA applications, particularly within the context of F-16 aircraft.

During this formative internship, I undertook the task of crafting a memory map utilizing bit-fields under the stringent MIL-STD-1553 communication protocol—a venture that not only broadened my technical acumen but also instilled a profound appreciation for the precision demanded in aviation systems. As a sophomore, my journey extended to the implementation of a finite state machine, a digital-to-analog alchemy, skillfully executed on the MYD-C7Z015 Development Board, and guided by the exacting standards of LTC-2601. In the realms of HAVELSAN EHSIM, I navigated the complexities of this transformation, laying the groundwork for a nuanced understanding of electronic warfare suite controllers for F-16 aircrafts.
