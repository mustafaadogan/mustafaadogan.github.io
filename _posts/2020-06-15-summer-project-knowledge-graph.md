In the realm of academic exploration, I spearheaded the construction of a comprehensive Knowledge Graph, intricately mapping out authors and their respective citations within academic papers. This intricate web of scholarly connections was meticulously curated from papers stored in a MongoDB database, facilitated by a user-friendly Python script that I skillfully crafted.

Delving further into the domain of machine learning, I conceptualized and developed a cutting-edge model. This sophisticated algorithm not only discerned the tasks performed and anticipated within academic papers but also employed the finesse of natural language processing to cluster these papers, thereby unraveling nuanced patterns and insights.

In tandem with this, I dedicated my efforts to a script that artfully generated concise reports on user-defined topics. Harnessing the capabilities of a previous machine learning model and the intricate design of GPT-2, I crafted a tool that synthesized a succinct narrative of the tasks accomplished and future endeavors, adding a layer of sophistication to the realm of academic exploration.
